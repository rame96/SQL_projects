# Sales Data Analysis Project
# Overview
This project involves the creation, exploration, and analysis of sales data stored in a database. The dataset includes various fields related to transactions, such as transactions_id, sale_date, sale_time, customer_id, gender, age, category, quantity, price_per_unit, cogs, and total_sale.
